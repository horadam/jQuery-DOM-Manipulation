You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs.</p>

                    <p>Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. That's my family Kay, that's not me.
